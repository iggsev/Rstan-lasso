# Customer Churn Analysis in Telecommunications: A Bayesian Approach

## Overview
 This repository documents our journey in creating a robust and insightful churn prediction model for the telecommunications sector.

## Repository Contents
- **Analytical Notebooks**: Comprehensive R Markdown detailing the steps of Bayesian modeling.
- **Data**: Dataset from the `modeldata` package, utilized for churn analysis.
- **Visualizations**: Insightful charts and visualizations derived from the model outputs.

## Key Objectives and Methodology
- **Model Refinement**: Incorporating LASSO priors and removing irrelevant variables to improve model accuracy and focus.
- **Diagnostic Analysis**: Conducting thorough diagnostics including Effective Sample Size (ESS), Rhat, and Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOO) to ensure model reliability and validity.
- **Performance Enhancement**: Achieving significant improvements in computational efficiency and predictive accuracy with the final model iteration.

## Results and Insights
Our final model demonstrates the critical importance of an international plan, total credits charged, and customer service calls in predicting customer churn. The application of Bayesian methods, coupled with strategic model enhancements, has led to a powerful analytical tool for understanding customer behavior in the telecom industry.
